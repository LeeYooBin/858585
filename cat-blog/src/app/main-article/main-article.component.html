      Cats are fascinating animals and surrounded by mysteries. With an independent and mysterious temperament,
      these felines are known for their agility, elegance and often unpredictable behavior. However, recently,
      a theory has been gaining ground on the internet and among conspiracy theorists: could cats be astronauts? <br>
      The theory suggests that cats are not terrestrial animals, but extraterrestrial beings sent to carry
      out a specific mission on our planet. There are historical reports that point to the fact that cats
      were considered sacred beings in different cultures and were even associated with divine figures.
      This could indicate that cats have a much more mystical origin than previously thought. <br>
      Furthermore, there are theorists who believe that felines have telepathic
      abilities and are capable of communicating with other alien species. This belief is based on reports
      from people who claim to have seen cats reacting to stimuli that are not perceptible to humans, or
      even behaving in unusual ways during astronomical events, such as the Northern Lights. These and other
      signs were interpreted as signs that cats were interplanetary beings.
